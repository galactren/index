<h1>Y, Rithya
    </h1>
<p>Hello, My name is Rithya. Yes, My last name is just the letter Y.
    I am an adoptee.
    I am currently a student at Cerritos College pursuing an Associates in Computer Science.
    I was a medic in the U.S. Army and currently a tow truck driver.
    My hobbies are computers, cars, motorcycles, and traveling/outdoor adventures.
    My goals for the future is to learn more about programming and write clean code. The position I want to be in is that of an AWS certified cloud practitioner.
    </p>
<h2>
    When I have free time
    </h2>
 <ol>
    <li>Hiking and camping in various campsites and trails
     </li>
    <li>Working and modifying my cars and bikes
     </li>
    <li>Learning about the environment and the oceans of the world
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>My favorite website to use is <a href="https://www.nps.gov/subjects/oceans/ocean-life.htm">NPS GOV</a>
    because it provides up to date information on new ocean discoveries and the condition of our oceans</p>
